DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

php artisan jwt:generate
```

Front-end

You need to have npm and bower installed globaly
```
npm install
bower install
```

## Front-end tools
To make the development easy we use grunt. To start developing run ```grunt serve``` it will compile stylus, add new dependencies to the index.html and enable live reload (by default the livereload server runs on the port 3000 and points to http://local.tdangularjslaravel.com/, you can change this on the Gruntfile.js file).

## Test
Front-end

To run the tests of the front-end you need karma and karma-cli (install them globaly with npm).  
Run ``` grunt karma```, or ```karma start```for more details.  
You can see the coverage report by oppening coverage/<browser>/index.html.

## Demo

2. User > Create a new user (POST)
3. Auth > Authenticate an user (login POST)
4. Copy Token to the Navigation bar input, click Explore
5. User > List users (GET)
